# Orbito Board Game

Orbito is a strategic and dynamic board game where the objective is to align four marbles of your chosen color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the shifting game board. Before completing your turn, you must press the 'Orbito' button, causing all marbles to shift one position on their orbit.

## How to play:

1. Move one of your opponent's marbles to an adjacent, empty square.
2. Place one of your own marbles onto any free position on the board.
3. Press the Orbito-button to finish your turn.

The first player to get a sequence of 4 marbles after the button is pressed wins the game. If there are no empty spaces left, just press the Orbito-button up to 5 more times. If there is no sequence after that, it's a draw!
